# Bellybutton Biodiversity

In this project, I have created interactive charts with data on belly buttons and the different species of bacteria. When a sample ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species of the sample's belly button are displayed.

There is also an interactive bubble chart that updates with each sample selected.

Try it out yourself using the [Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard](https://natrockwood.github.io/bellybutton_biodiversity/).
